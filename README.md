About the Dataset
The dataset is provided by Divvy (Chicago’s bike-share program) and contains anonymized trip-level data, including ride type, timestamps, stations, and user type.

Phase 3: Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values (`start_station_name`, `end_station_name`)
- Removed duplicates
- Converted `started_at` and `ended_at` to datetime
- Calculated `ride_length` and removed invalid durations
- Saved a 500-row sample for sharing: [`data_cleaned/cyclistic_cleaned_sample.csv`](data_cleaned/cyclistic_cleaned_sample.csv)
- Cleaned dataset saved locally for further analysis

Planned Deliverables
- Data Cleaning & Preparation ✅
